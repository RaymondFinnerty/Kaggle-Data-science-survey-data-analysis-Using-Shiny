### Aim and Motivation of this Project

This is a data analytics project for analyzing and studying the data collected by the Kaggle Data science survey conducted in 2017 to understand and explore various trends in Data science industry and how interested people are in this buzz word. The data set has tonnes of information and lots of variables.

The motivation behind this project was my own curiosity and my own interest to understand and study the trends in data science. It's just that I love exploring and communicating with data. This is my favorite and most important part of any data science project i.e to know your dataset well.
